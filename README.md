# GetX Shopping App
Simple shopping app project using GetX and Sqlite. The Getx package is really intresting and
wonderful to work with. it has several cons: 

- It's easy to do state management
- Provides MVC pattern
- Less code than flutter itself 
- And tons of other intresting functionalities
- Stripe payment integration (in-progress)

[Visit official `GetX` repository](https://github.com/jonataslaw/getx).
